# 🌍 Post-COVID Economic Impact Analysis using Machine Learning

This project analyzes the economic and social impacts of the post-COVID era using real-world datasets and applies machine learning models to derive insightful predictions.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

We used datasets such as:
- 🌐 Global Economic Indicators
- 🇮🇳 India-specific Post-COVID data

The project aims to:
- Visualize how different countries, especially India, were economically affected post-COVID.
- Predict economic recovery using regression models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Features

- Combined datasets from multiple sources (global + India)
- Preprocessed and visualized economic trends
- Applied Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression
- Visualized predictions vs actual values
- Exported trained ML models

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com)  
2. Upload both `economic data.csv` and `indian_data.csv` manually when prompted
3. Run all cells to see visualizations and model outputs
